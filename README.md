# Bayesian Workflow on Time to Reach Global Top 20 in Tennis 🎾

This repository contains the materials and code for our Bayesian Data Analysis project, completed as part of the Bayesian Data Analysis course instructed by **Aki Vehtari** at **Aalto University**. 

The project investigates the time it takes for professional tennis players to reach the global top 20 rankings, using Bayesian modeling techniques. We utilized **Gamma** and **Gaussian** models to explore regional and country-level effects.

## Project Overview 📊

### Problem Definition
- **Goal**: Analyze the time it takes for tennis players to reach the global top 20 and identify regional/country-level effects on their progression.
- **Dataset**: Sourced from Kaggle, containing 106,716 rows with 49 variables such as:
  - Match-level: Date, Surface, Duration
  - Player stats: Name, Nationality, Age
  - Rank info: Winner Rank, Loser Rank, Rank Points

### Key Insights
1. Regional and country-level effects significantly influence the time to top rankings.
2. **Gamma models** performed better than Gaussian models in capturing variability, despite some challenges with rare rapid risers.
3. Weakly informative priors ensured generalizability while balancing model stability.

## Methods 🔧

### Statistical Models
1. **Gamma Model**:
   - Designed for skewed, positive data like time-to-event.
 
2. **Gaussian Model**:
   - Symmetric model assuming normally distributed data.

### Priors
- Weakly informative priors were selected to ensure stable convergence:
  - Gamma model intercept: log-scale.
  - Gaussian model intercept.

## Results 📈

1. **Model Performance**:
   - Gamma model: Better generalization with elpd_loo= -1543.9.
   - Gaussian model: Higher sampling efficiency but less reliable predictions.

2. **Posterior Predictive Checks**:
   - Gamma model outperformed in capturing variability of rare rapid risers.
   - Gaussian model over-predicted negative times (unrealistic for this problem).

3. **Key Findings**:
   - Players from Sweden and Russia exhibit shorter times to reach the top 20.
   - Asian players perform well on clay courts.
